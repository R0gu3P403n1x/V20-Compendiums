The immortal literally sinks into the bare ground, transmuting his substance to bond with the earth. Though a vampire can immerse himself fully into the ground, he cannot move around within it. Further, it is impossible to meld into earth through another substance. Wood slats, blacktop, even artificial turf blocks Earth Meld&rsquo;s effectiveness &mdash; then again, it&rsquo;s a relatively simple matter for a vampire at this level of power to grow claws and rip apart enough of the flooring to expose the raw soil beneath.&nbsp;<br>By interring himself in the ground, the vampire gains full protection from daylight when outdoors. It is also the method of choice for those Kindred who wish to sleep away the centuries; these vampires lock themselves in the earth&rsquo;s embrace, gaining strength and power as they rest. Superstitious and paranoid Kindred whisper that thousands of Ancients sleep within the ground and will awaken when Gehenna arrives.<br>While so interred, the vampire is in a transitional state between flesh and earth. His physical presence exists between the physical world and the astral plane. As such, the vampire is difficult to sense, even through supernatural means.

Astral individuals cannot affect the vampire directly, instead meeting with a kind of spongy resistance as their hands pass through him. Similarly, digging in the material world encounters incredibly hardpacked earth, virtually as dense as stone.<br>Attempts at violence upon the submerged vampire from either side return him to his physical nature, expelling the soil with which he bonded in a blinding spray (all Perception-based rolls are at +2 difficulty for the turn). The character himself subtracts two from his initiative for the first turn after his restoration, due to momentary disorientation.

Once the Kindred overwhelms the subject&rsquo;s mind, the vampire moves his consciousness into the victim&rsquo;s body and controls it as easily as he uses his own. The mortal falls into a mental fugue while under possession. She is aware of events only in a distorted, dreamlike fashion.

The vampire may also venture out during the day in the mortal form. However, the vampire&rsquo;s own body must be awake to do so, requiring a successful roll to remain awake (see p. 262). If the vampire leaves the mortal shell (by choice, if his body falls asleep, through supernatural expulsion, after sustaining significant injury, etc.), his consciousness returns to his physical form in an instant. Once freed from possession, the mortal regains mental control of herself. This can happen in an instant, or the victim may lie comatose for days while her psyche copes with the violation.<br>The vampire experiences everything the mortal body feels during possession, from pleasure to pain. In fact, any damage the victim&rsquo;s body sustains is also applied to the character&rsquo;s body (though the Kindred may soak as normal). If the mortal dies before the vampire&rsquo;s soul can flee from the body, the character&rsquo;s body falls into torpor.

Botching this roll is even more catastrophic; the heightened frenzy grows so extreme that not even expending Willpower curbs its duration or effects.

While no longer vulnerable to frenzy, the character cannot use or regain Willpower and becomes increasingly lethargic.

One success is sufficient to have a cat follow an individual and lead the character to the same location, three successes are enough to have a raven spy on a target for weeks, and five successes ensure that a grizzly ferociously guards the entrance to the character&rsquo;s wilderness haven for some months.<br>The character&rsquo;s Nature plays a large part in how he approaches these conversations. The character might try intimidating, teasing, cajoling, or rationalizing. The player should understand that he does not simply play his character in these situations, but the Beast Within as well.<br>Using this power cannot force an animal to do something against its nature, or to force a creature to risk its life. While the aforementioned grizzly would stand guard to the vampire&rsquo;s haven and even fight for it, it would not do so against obviously superior numbers or something overwhelmingly supernatural. A predatory bird might be convinced to harry a target, but would definitely not hold ground. A docile dog or skittish cat would have no problem with reporting something it had seen, but it wouldn&rsquo;t enter combat unless given no other option &mdash; though it would likely agree to stand and fight and then flee at the first opportunity, if a harsh Kindred demanded it.</p>","property":[],"type":"wod.types.disciplinepower","level":"1","value":0,"max":5,"category":"","dice1":"","dice2":"","bonus":0,"difficulty":0,"isrollable":false,"spendwillpower":false,"spendrage":false,"spendgnosis":false,"spendblood":false,"spendglamour":false,"game":"vampire","arttype":""},"effects":[],"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.ccqb6e3yoGpJYBpi"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldofdarkness","systemVersion":"3.2.14","coreVersion":"11.315","createdTime":1689218183742,"modifiedTime":1705801261564,"lastModifiedBy":"tJTJahC22fad7i25"},"_id":"ccqb6e3yoGpJYBpi","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"tJTJahC22fad7i25":3}}

Over time, the victim becomes increasingly susceptible to the vampire&rsquo;s influence while simultaneously growing more resistant to the corrupting efforts of other Kindred. Gaining complete control over a subject&rsquo;s mind is no small task, taking weeks or even months to accomplish. Kindred often fill their retainers&rsquo; heads with subtle whispers and veiled urges, thereby ensuring these mortals&rsquo; loyalty. Yet vampires must pay a high price for the minds they ensnare.

Conditioning is an extended action, for which the Storyteller secretly determines the number of successes required. It typically requires between five and 10 times the subject&rsquo;s Self-Control/Instinct rating. Targets with more empathic Natures may require a lower number of successes, while those with willful Natures require a higher total. Only through roleplaying may a character discern whether his subject is conditioned successfully.<br>A target may become more tractable even before becoming fully conditioned. Once the vampire accumulates half the required number of successes, the Storyteller may apply a lower difficulty to the vampire&rsquo;s subsequent uses of Dominate. After being conditioned, the target falls so far under the vampire&rsquo;s influence that the Kindred need not make eye contact or even be present to retain absolute control. The subject does exactly as she is told (including taking actions that would injure herself), as long as her master can communicate with her verbally. No command roll is necessary unless the subject is totally isolated from the vampire&rsquo;s presence (in a different room, over the phone). Even if a command roll fails, the target will still likely carry out part of the orders given, simply because her master wishes it.<br>After the subject is fully conditioned, other Kindred find her more difficult to Dominate. Such conditioning raises others&rsquo; difficulties by two (to a maximum of 10). It is possible, though difficult, to shake Conditioning. The subject must be separated entirely from the vampire to whom she was in thrall. This period of separation varies depending on the individual, but the Storyteller may set it at six months, less a number of weeks equal to the subject&rsquo;s permanent Willpower rating (so a person with 5 Willpower must stay away from the vampire for just under five months). The subject regains her personality slowly during this time, though she may still lapse into brief spells of listlessness, despair, or even anger. If the vampire encounters the target before that time passes, a single successful Charisma + Leadership roll (difficulty of the target&rsquo;s current Willpower points) on the part of the vampire completely reasserts the dominance.<br>If the subject makes it through the time period without intervention by her master, the target regains her former individuality. Even so, the vampire may reestablish conditioning more easily than the first time, since the subject is now predisposed to falling under the Kindred&rsquo;s mental control.

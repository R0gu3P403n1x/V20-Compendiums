It causes others to feel a certain way toward the vampire, but does not give her outright control over them.

An Obfuscated vampire doesn&rsquo;t actually become invisible, however &mdash; rather, he is able to delude observers into believing that he has vanished. Obfuscate also allows Kindred to change their features and conceal other people or objects. Typically vampires using Obfuscate must be within a short range of their witnesses (approximately five yards or meters per dot of Wits + Stealth) for their power to be effective.&nbsp;<br>Unless the Kindred chooses to make herself seen, she can remain obscured for as long as she wills it. At higher levels, the vampire can actually fade from sight so subtly that those nearby can&rsquo;t actually recall the moment at which she left.<br>Usually, few mortals or supernaturals (even those trained in Awareness) can pierce through the fog of Obfuscate. Animals, who rely more on their instincts than their normal senses, can sometime perceive (and be frightened by) the vampire&rsquo;s presence. Children and those to whom deception is foreign may also be able to pierce the illusion, at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion. Finally, the Auspex Discipline enables Kindred to see through Obfuscate. Even that is not guaranteed, however; refer to &ldquo;Seeing the Unseen,&rdquo; p. 142, for more details. (Storytellers needing a die roll for animals or children can use this quick and dirty guideline: treat them as if they had Auspex 1 in terms of contesting Obfuscate. They do not have the Auspex 1 power, but are considered to have it when determining whether a vampire is noticed.)<br>Since Obfuscate clouds the mind of the viewer, vampires can&rsquo;t use it to hide their presence from electronic or mechanical devices. Video and photo cameras, for example, capture the vampire&rsquo;s image accurately. Even so, the person using, say, her cell phone to record an Obfuscated vampire will still have her mind impacted by the power, and she won&rsquo;t see the Kindred&rsquo;s image until she views the video at a later date (if even then).<br>Several Clans cultivate this power &mdash; the Assamites, Followers of Set, and Malkavians, for example &mdash; but the Nosferatu are particularly known for this Discipline.

Thaumaturgical paths are applications of the vampire&rsquo;s knowledge of blood magic, allowing her to create effects on a whim.

That path is considered the character&rsquo;s primary path, and she automatically receives one dot in it, as well as one Level One ritual. Thereafter, whenever the character increases her level in Thaumaturgy, her rating in the primary path increases by one as well. Additional rituals are learned separately, as part of a story; players need not pay experience points for their characters to learn rituals up to the level equal to their overall rating in Thaumaturgy, though they must find someone to teach the rituals in question. Path ratings never exceed 5, though the overall Thaumaturgy score may. If a character reaches a rating of 5 in her primary path and increases her Thaumaturgy score afterward, she may allocate her &ldquo;free&rdquo; path dot to a different path.
